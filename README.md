# Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz
    “A thousand years or more ago,
    When I was newly sewn,
    There lived four wizards of renown,
    Whose names are still well known.”


The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry welcomes you! First-year students must go through the annual Sorting Ceremony.


The Sorting Hat is a talking hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to:

 * gryffindor
 * hufflepuff
 * ravenclaw
 * slytherin

Write a sortinghat.cpp program that asks the user some questions and places them into one of the four Houses based on their answers!
